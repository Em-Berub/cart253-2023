Project 2 Proposal

For my final project I wish to create a code that will put the emphasis on 
aesthetics rather than interactivity.
I would like to create a program that corresponds to my sense of beauty. 
I understand that functionality is at the core of JavaScript and I will try to implemente
some forms of interactivity but it won't be about aiming to a specific goal or resolving a specific issue.
